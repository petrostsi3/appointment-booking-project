## What This Project Actually Does

This is basically a web app where businesses can let customers book appointments online. Think of it like when you book a haircut or doctor's visit online, but for any kind of business.

The whole system has two main parts:
- **Backend**: A Django/Python API that handles all the data and business logic
- **Frontend**: A React app that users actually see and interact with

## Why I Built This Project

I wanted to solve a real problem that small businesses face - managing appointments manually is a pain. This system lets them:
- Set up their services and pricing
- Let customers book online 24/7
- Manage their schedule without the back-and-forth phone calls
- Track business analytics

## Tech Stack 

**Backend:**
- Django & Django REST Framework (Python)
- PostgreSQL database
- JWT authentication
- Email notifications

**Frontend:**
- React.js 
- Bootstrap for styling 
- Axios for API calls
- React Router for navigation

## How to Actually Run This Thing

### Prerequisites
You'll need these installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- Git

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/petrostsi3/appointment-booking-project
   cd appointment_system
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (seriously, do this):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
   ```

3. **Navigate to backend folder and install Python packages:**
   ```bash
   cd backend 
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a superuser (admin account):**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend 
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Now you should have:
- Backend running on `http://localhost:8000`
- Frontend running on `http://localhost:3000`
